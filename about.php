    <p>Iâ€™m a passionate, progressive front-end web developer with 4+ years of experience in website development.  I have developed almost a hundred web pages, working closely with a design team to transform a photoshop document from a flat file to an interactive customer experience.  Throughout my years in development I have worked across a wide range of interactive projects for both traditional and mobile web devices with an empshasis on responsive web design and web standards/usability.  I love what I do and am always reading about the latest trends in web development.</p>
    <br /> <p>When I am not on a computer, I am usually in the kitchen cooking, baking, or I have my nose in a good book (aka pressed up close to my iPad).</p>
