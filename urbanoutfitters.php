        <p>Over the four years at Urban Outfitters a few of the projects I worked on included:</p>

        <p>A product detail page developed using HTML5 and jQuery (includes metadata for SEO, custom-built in-page zoom/pan and social networking API integration)</p>

        <p>Mobile store locator page integrated with Google Geolocations API</p>

        <p>Unconventional slideshow funcitonality for microsites without plugins, working closely with a designer to determine what elements of functionality could be incorporated and which were not possible</p>

        <p>Reworked the code for dropdown menu using few lines of javascript for quicker download speeds and smoother animation</p>
