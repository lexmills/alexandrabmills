        <p>For this project I worked with a small group to create a mobile specific application since the current web application was not scalable in its current iteration.  I was put in charge of researching javascript frameworks; mainly focusing on Angular, Ember and Backbone.  In the end I determined that Angular would be the best for our purposes.</p>
        <p>The next step was the UI design and functionality, which I was an integral part of throughout.  For development I worked with a backend engineer who provided the api and I was in charge of almost all front end development.</p>
