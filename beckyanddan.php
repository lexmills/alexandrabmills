        <p>This site is a wedding site I designed and developed using the CMS Drupal.  I worked with the bride to create a site that would be a “one stop” for guests to get all information for the wedding; integrating with google maps api to provide directions to destinations, registry information and a gallery for guests to browse images of the couple throughout the years of their relationship.</p>
